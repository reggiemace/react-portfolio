          Hi, My name is Reggie!!! I am a 22 year Army Veteran making the
          transition from Soldier to a new career as full stack web developer. I
          am currently working as software project lead for a DoD program. I am
          interested in creating things and solving problems. I have sought ways
          to improve existing skills and develop new skills by any means
          available that will accommodate a busy schedule. I am a proud father
          and grandfather. I am originally from Charleston SC. I like listening
          to music and staying fit, which I find gets harder to do as you get
          older! Below is a sample of the work that I've done while a student at
          John Hopkins Full Stack BootCamp. Please take a look!
